Notes Jetendar 27-11-2022:

Nothing much to worry about report/thesis
Rasa part is done
Classical machine learning is done
Main is Deep Learning solution 

Deep Learning Solutions:
Explain about background and approaches
Show research papers related to those approaches

Things to remember:
We have used two DL models: LSTM and CNN
LSTM: https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/creating-your-own-intent-classifier-b86e000a4926
